# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. 📚

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?

```
A Type 1 architecture (overwriting) poses fewer privacy risks as it only retains the current address, minimizing data exposure in case of breaches. Type 2 (retaining history) increases risk since it stores past addresses, leading to larger data footprints and higher exposure if compromised.

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
### Differences:
1. **AdventureWorks** has more detailed entities and relationships, including more specific tables like Product, ProductCategory, etc.
2. **AdventureWorks** includes more complex relationships and additional attributes for each entity.

### Changes to My ERD:
- I would consider adding more detailed attributes to each entity to capture more specific information.
- I might also add more entities to capture additional aspects of the bookstore operations, such as Inventory and Supplier.
